# C++ profile

Top rule: Make resource ownership and borrowed lifetimes explicit.

## 1 Structure

- Default: group APIs by capability; no mandatory directory or target per capability.
- Default: keep private headers private and expose small value-oriented APIs.
- Heuristic: split libraries/targets for real consumer or build boundaries.

## 2 Preferred

- Default: use the repository-supported stable standard; C++20 is the conservative fallback.
- Requirement: use RAII for owned resources, including failure paths.
- Default: use values and `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive dynamic ownership.
- Requirement: make `std::span`/`std::string_view` borrowing lifetimes explicit;
  views must not outlive backing storage or survive invalidating mutations.
- Default: use `std::optional` for absence and tagged values for business outcomes.
- Default: use exceptions for operational failures; exception-free targets use
  explicit result/status types consistently, not unchecked success assumptions.
- Default: synchronous calls first; concurrency only for demonstrated need.
- Requirement: own tasks/threads, cancel or request stop, join, and observe failures.
- Default: use `enum class`, `constexpr`, and meaningful `[[nodiscard]]` results.

## 3 Disallowed

- Default: avoid owning raw pointers; isolate low-level allocation adapters.
- Requirement: no dangling views, uninitialized values, or unchecked size arithmetic.
- Default: avoid C-style casts, macro control flow, and `using namespace` in headers.

## 4 Canonical

Use repository code only when compliant with the adopted contract.
No bundled C++ example; C++20 does not require C++23 `std::expected`.

## 5 Verification

Requirement: compile with strict warnings, analyze, format, and test with supported
sanitizers; check header/target dependencies. Tools do not prove architecture.
Default: use repository-supported stable tools; commands below are fallbacks,
not required dependencies. Configure warning and sanitizer flags in the build.

```verify
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
clang-tidy -p build $(git ls-files '*.cpp' '*.cc' '*.cxx')
clang-format --dry-run --Werror $(git ls-files '*.cpp' '*.cc' '*.cxx' '*.hpp' '*.h')
```

Boundaries: `templates/boundaries/CMakeLists.layering.txt`
Lint config: `templates/boundaries/.clang-tidy`
Requirement: baseline existing diagnostics by rule/location; reject new findings.
Use reviewed, bounded suppressions, never blanket-skip targets or safety checks.
Exceptions follow `standards/contract.md`.
