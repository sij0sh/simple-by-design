Set `S` to this skill's absolute directory. From the task project:

```sh
python3 "$S/scripts/sbd.py" --request '<request, constraints, permissions>'
```

Bare invocation resumes. Do the returned prompt; submit through its printed command. Repeat until `DONE`. If blocked, obtain the answer and pause. Design only; no implementation.
